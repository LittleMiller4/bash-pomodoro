# bash-pomodoro

A pomodoro timer that runs in the shell

This is a simple bash script that runs a pomodoro timer in the terminal.  It gives you 25 minutes on, asks for what you did (which it logs in a file called "pomodoro"), and then gives you a 5-minute break.

It uses send-notify and a sound clip to encourage you to go back to it.
